# mediapy
A Cpython implementation of media.py

To use the functions: from mymedia import *

Requires PIL, numpy, and pyaudio to work.

I recommend using enthough canopy, as it comes with all three prerequisites.

If you're having trouble running things, try executing in a pydev workspace. (I use liclipse).
