# mediapy
A Cpython implementation of media.py


To execute a file, edit jes.py to name the file you want (defaults to test.py), then execute from the root directory.

Requires PIL, numpy, and pyaudio to work.

I recommend using enthough canopy, as it comes with all three prerequisites.

If you're having trouble running things, try executing in a pydev workspace. (I use liclipse).
